<h1>From Clogs to Code: A Modern Plumber Website Project</h1>
Degree Project FED23S Medieinstitutet

<h2>Project idea summary</h2>
The project involves creating a website for a plumbing company. The website will serve as a platform where customers can learn about the company's services and get in touch for assistance. It will feature an "About Us" section, a list of services, and a contact form for customer inquiries. Additionally, the company will have the ability to update and edit the content as needed.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
I came up with this idea after my friend told me that her brother, who owns a plumbing company, needed a website. Many small businesses don’t have a proper online presence, which makes it hard for customers to find them. Having a website is important nowadays because most people look online first when they need help with something like plumbing.

This project will create a simple and clear website that shows what the plumbing company offers and makes it easy for customers to get in touch. It will help the business be more visible online, attract more clients, and give them an easy way to update the site with new information when needed.

<h2>Target audience</h2>
The target audience for this project includes homeowners, property managers, and business owners who need plumbing services. They are interested because they often deal with issues like leaks, clogs, or broken pipes and need a trustworthy plumber to fix them quickly. This website will help these potential clients easily find information about the company and contact them for help.

<h2>Goal</h2>

The goal is to enhance my skills as a frontend developer and deliver a fully functional, responsive website for the plumbing company. By the end of the project, the website should be ready for use and meet all planned features.

The website will serve as a resource for homeowners and property managers looking for plumbing services. It will provide clear information about the company, showcase its services, and include a contact form to make it easy for users to request help.

<h2>Tech stack</h2>
<h3>Programming Languages/Frameworks:</h3>
<h4>Frontend:</h4> React with TypeScript, which is easy to use and I learned it in school.
<h4>Backend:</h4> Supabase was chosen for its simplicity in database management and real-time features. I’ve learned more about it through this project, as backend development is an interesting and crucial part of the process.
<h3>Database Structure:</h3>
A PostgreSQL database provided by Supabase was used to store information, such as website text content and form submissions. Supabase was an easier solution to work with, especially since I didn’t have much experience building databases.
<h3>Testing:</h3>
I performed manual testing throughout the development process, addressing any bugs immediately to avoid delays and ensure smooth progress. Additionally, I involved the client and test users to gather feedback and verify that the site functions as intended, both from a technical and user experience perspective. 
<h3>Deployment:</h3>
Netlify was used to deploy the frontend, offering fast and reliable hosting. As this was my first time deploying with Netlify, it was a great opportunity to learn and gain hands-on experience with the platform.
<h3>Development Configuration:</h3>
Using ESLint and Prettier ensured consistent code quality and style. 
Vite provided a fast and optimized development environment. I had used it before in school projects, so it was a familiar tool.
<h3>Graphics:</h3>
I used Lucide for the icon part. The styling was finalized using Tailwind. Tailwind was very easy after I read the documentation and experimented with writing everything in the class names.
